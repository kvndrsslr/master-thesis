\chapter*{Acknowledgments}
I would like to thank everyone who supported me through the past three years.

First and foremost, thanks go to my supervisor Dr. Mohamed Ahmed Sherif for his professional as well as personal support, patience and believe in my abilities.

I also thank Prof. Dr. Axel-Cyrille Ngonga Ngomo for introducing me to research years ago, giving me the benefit of the doubt and enabling me to have my first journal paper before even handing in my bachelors thesis.\\

Further thanks goes to everyone in the DICE research group that answered my questions or helped me getting around organizational or software issues when running my experiments.\\

Last but not least, I most genuinely thank my parents for their unconditional love and support throughout all of my life.
